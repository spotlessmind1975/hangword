''' INITIALIZATION PHASE
'''---------------------------------------------------------------------------

' The first pragma command is used to make the compiler more strict about 
' the use of variables. Using this option, the compiler will stop with an 
' error if the variable is used without being previously defined with a 
' DIM (or VAR) command.

OPTION EXPLICIT

' Then, it is necessary to apply some techniques to reduce the memory actually 
' used, so that the game can run even on rather limited platforms.

' Next, we use this pragma to make SOUND commands synchronous with the 
' execution: it means that the sound will be played entirely before 
' continuing execution.

DEFINE AUDIO SYNC
	
' No we enable the RLE compression of the images, if available.

DEFINE COMPRESSION RLE ON

' Let's proceed to reduce the space occupied by dynamic strings. 
' In ugBASIC this space, despite being dynamic, is statically allocated 
' and occupies a certain memory space. With this pragma we tell ugBASIC 
' that we will never use more than 128 bytes to manage (dynamic) strings. 
' Static strings, such as those in quotes, don't count.
	
DEFINE STRING SPACE 128
	
' We also reduce the number of (dynamic) strings that can exist at any 
' given time, to a maximum of 64.
	
DEFINE STRING COUNT 64

' This other pragma asks ugBASIC to reduce the footprint of the
' generated code, excluding everything that is not used except 
' that which is valid for the (only) graphics mode that will be used. 
' In other words, with this command it will not be possible to use 
' different graphics modes in the same program. On the other hand, 
' you will get a fair improvement in the memory occupation of the code.	
	
DEFINE SCREEN MODE UNIQUE

' We enable the "bitmap" graphics mode. This is the mode in which 
' each individual pixel can be addressed individually, via primitive 
' commands, such as those related to drawing entire images. The (16)
' means that we could have up to 16 colors.

BITMAP ENABLE(16)

' We set the border color to black, at least for those targets for 
' which this instruction makes sense. Since ugBASIC is an isomorphic 
' language, it does not provide an abstraction of the concept of 
' "border". Therefore, if the border exists, it will be colored, 
' otherwise this statement corresponds to a "no operation".

COLOR BORDER BLACK

' Define variable is a very useful practice to ensure that the 
' memory space occupied is as optimized as possible. In 
' this specific case, this variable is used to iterate,

' BYTE variable so that the increments and comparisons 
' are as fast as possible.

''' RESOURCE LOADING
'''---------------------------------------------------------------------------

' With ugBASIC it is possible to read graphic resources directly from the 
' modern format (PNG, JPG, BMP, and so on), as the compiler takes care of 
' converting them to the target format. To do this, automatic algorithms 
' take care of many important phases, such as (for example) the construction 
' of an optimized palette. For this reason, in addition to indicating the 
' name of the file from which to read the graphic resource, it is possible 
' to suggest to ugBASIC how to treat the various images. Finally, in those 
' cases where targets can benefit from dedicated resources, it is possible 
' to create a folder with the name of the target to store the specific version 
' for that target, which will be loaded instead of the standard one.

' In this case, we are going to read the image used to draw the gibbet.
' To save space, the image has been cropped into two parts, which are drawn 
' one below the other, and left aligned to each other.
'

''' CONSTANT (AND POSITION CALCULATION)
'''---------------------------------------------------------------------------

' Once the graphic resources have been loaded, each of which may have specific
' dimensions related to the type of machine used, we can calculate a series of
' constants that we will use to draw objects on the screen. The advantage of 
' using constants is that they are calculated once and for all by the 
' compiler and they do not take up space on the executable, as they are used 
' directly in the generated code. Note that we not only define a constant, 
' but we require ugBASIC to verify that its value is greater than zero. 
' This check is essential because it is possible that the resolution of the 
' chosen target is not sufficient to maintain all the graphic elements. 
' In this way, the compilation will be interrupted if the game cannot be 
' executed due to exceeding the graphic limits.

' This is the overall scaling for the images used. We use two sets of images,
' one "small" (80 pixel based) and one "large" (160 pixel based). We use one 
' or the other on a target basis.
